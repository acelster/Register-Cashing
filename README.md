Register-Cashing
================

This is the code for the paper:

Falch, Thomas L.; Elster, Anne C., "Register Caching for Stencil Computations on GPUs,"
Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC), 2014 16th International Symposium on 

The code demonstrates how the __shuffle() intrinsic can be used to create a user managed cache of registers for stencil computations.

The code was written by Thomas L. Falch at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. See the LICENCE file for terms of useage and distribution.
